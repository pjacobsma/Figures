# Figures
Figures is a free, simple-to-use, flexible money management application.  It is light-weight and fast, and stores your data in a SQLite database, which can be optionally encrypted.  You can import and export your data in OFX or QIF formats. 

Figures allows you to track your banking and credit card transactions by spending categories while at the same time you control how the transactions are displayed.  It provides powerful search options so you can quickly and easily find transactions.  And Figures has a flexible report generator so you can summarize your transactions any way you like.
